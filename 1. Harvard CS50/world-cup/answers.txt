Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
With a small number of simulations the predictions are more aleatory, with a more number of simulations the predictions will be more accurate

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
After 10000 simulations because mantain the time above 1 second and are very accurate
