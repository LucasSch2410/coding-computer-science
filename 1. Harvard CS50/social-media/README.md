# SOCIAL MEDIA PICHAU

#### Description:
In my front-end, i used React. It's hard because i don't know much about, but i make a pages folder. This pages folder have a login webpage, that will calls to my backend with my python API. This will calls my route of AUTH2. This route is cool because i created a refresh token, that never expires, so the user don't need to make any login, just click in the button to create a new access token.

After this, i have a home page, that it's a page to put the Sheet URL and catch the name of all the products in a Google Docs Sheet. This will create a download button, that's will calls the API to download the image of the database, make all the work of scale the image, put the name (it's hard because needs to have a algorithm to detects if the words/phrase doesn't ultrapass the width), put all in the correct local and loads the background AND send to the user with a base64 response to the react decode and displays in the screen.

I already spoke about the backend, but it's very cool to make differents routes, with differents methods and all its like a clue that works together.
